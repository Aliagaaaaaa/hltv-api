### `HLTV.enableLogging(enabled)`

Enables or disables console logging for debugging purposes. Logging is disabled by default.

**Parameters:**
- `enabled` (boolean, optional): Set to `true` to enable logging, `false` to disable. Defaults to `true`.

**Example:**
```javascript
import { HLTV } from 'hltv-api-scraper';

// Enable logging
HLTV.enableLogging();
// or explicitly
HLTV.enableLogging(true);

// Later, disable logging if needed
HLTV.enableLogging(false);

// Now fetch data with logging enabled
const team = await HLTV.getTeam(6667);
```

When enabled, detailed logs about requests and parsing will appear in the console.
